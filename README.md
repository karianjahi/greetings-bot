# JavaScript Beginner Practice - Introduction Bot

## Overview
This is a simple JavaScript file created for beginner-level practice. It demonstrates basic JavaScript concepts such as:

- **Printing messages to the console** using `console.log()`
- **Variables** with `let` and `const`
- **String concatenation** to combine text and variables

The program introduces a fictional bot character and displays information about its name, nickname, location, and favorite subject.

---

## What the Program Does
1. Greets the user with a welcome message.
2. Introduces a bot using variables and string concatenation.
3. Shows how to update a `let` variable and use it to create new messages.
4. Demonstrates the difference between `let` (reassignable) and `const` (constant value).
5. Prints messages about the bot’s favorite subject.
6. Ends with a friendly farewell message.

## Key Concepts Practiced
- `console.log()`: Display messages in the console.

- `let`: Declare variables that can change values.

- `const`: Declare variables with values that cannot be changed.

- String concatenation: Combine variables with strings using the` +` operator.

## How to Run
1 Save the file as `bot.js`

2 Open your terminal and navigate to the file’s folder.

3 Run the file using `Node.js`:

```bash 
node bot-introduction.js
```


4 You should see the bot’s introduction messages printed line by line in the terminal.
